# ngpu : Native WebGPU library in Nim
Rendering library, targeting the design concepts of the WebGPU API.
Don't be fooled by the `web` in the name.  
This project's target is native gpu usage.


## wgpu wrapper
Handmade wrapper, with an automated buildsystem.  
Some parts of the wrapper were generated by a script, but they have all been heavily edited and renamed.  
All names have been changed to use idiomatic Nim, with extensive use of overloads  
to remove the need for the usual C's `WGPUCrazyLongAndRepetitive_Names` everywhere.

Current state:
- [ ] Linux suppport 
  - [x] Partial  _see the `examples/wgpu` folder_
  - [ ] Complete
- [ ] Windows support
- [ ] Mac support


## Build Requirements
```md
nim, nimble, rust    # For compiling the library
glfw                 # For window creation with GLFW3
```


## wgpu vs Dawn
The WebGPU API is currently tied to a division between wgpu and Dawn.  
This means that, with time, either one or the other might (or might not) fall out of use.  
In the end, the goal of this library is to use the same API concepts that WebGPU uses for rendering.  

This lib is currently using wgpu-native as its WebGPU backend.  
Dawn support might (or might not) be implemented in the future, depending on how the situation evolves.  


## Mandatory Disclaimers
This library goes beyond a raw wrapper, and takes assumptions on how rendering will be done.  
If you only want to access the wgpu wrapper, you can do `import ngpu/wgpu` instead.  
If you don't like the naming convention used in the wrapper, then do `import ngpu/wgpu/raw`.
